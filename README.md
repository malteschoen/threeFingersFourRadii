# what is this?
this repo documents the idea of using a profile extrusion die with there vertical fingers and a flat bottom to generate 6 internal corners (two per finger).

By varying the radii per corner, a wider rate of shear stresses can be achived at a fixed flowrate through the die. If at the same time the flow behaviour or extrudate surface quality per corner is monitored, a lot of data can be gathered in a very short time.

# An example
Let's say that flow is stable for a given corner with a large radius, but anomalous (poor extrudate surface quality) for another corner with a smaller radius.

Our conclusion is hence that the critical shear stress triggering the flow anomaly lies somewhere between the shear stresses calculated for each of the two corners.

| 4 |---|---| 12.2 kPa |
| 5 |---|---| 10.5 kPa |
